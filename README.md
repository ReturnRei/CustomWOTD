## Tweak Word of the day screensaver in MacOs to make your own lists

```
Usage

python3 wotd.py xyz.csv

Set the new screensaver language to Japanese
```

On the first run it copies the official Word of the day screensaver and installs a second copy 
Afterwards it clears the list and replaces it with the content of your new csv 

**Csv should be three columns wide** Kanji, Kana, Meaning for my usecase  
_This is a "hack" I use on my system, as always double check what you git clone_

Here's the result ![E1xgpBfXoAQwW-M](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/50523188/120007580-584ab980-bfda-11eb-9301-3d94862f0b99.jpg)

*PS: I believe this is useful as an addition to an anki deck for SRS learning*
