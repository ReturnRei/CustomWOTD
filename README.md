## Tweak Word of the day screensaver in MacOs to make your own lists

#### In the project there's a ruby csv parser and a shell script that will make your custom dictionary given a csv

You can use my csv (Which has a list of Japanese vocabulary words) or override it with yours, just make sure it is named "toplist.csv" and is separated by semicolon

*The fields of your csv will appear one after the other, as this project was meant to learn Japanese if you use my csv you will have Kanji, followed by Hiragana writing and followed by its English translation*

`./makenewdic.sh`

Install the newly created dictionary and select Japanese as a language

Here's the result ![E1xgpBfXoAQwW-M](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/50523188/120007580-584ab980-bfda-11eb-9301-3d94862f0b99.jpg)

*PS: I believe this is useful as an addition to an anki deck for SRS learning*
